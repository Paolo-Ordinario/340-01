## About Me
Hello I am a Junior at UNCG and my Major is computer science with a minor in mathermatics. I like to go to the gym, play video games with friends, and play volleyball aswell.

## My CSC340 Goals
My goal for CSC340 is to complete this project of course but to also learn web development. I think this will be a really fun project.
